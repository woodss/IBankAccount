C# Tutorial showing how to use Interfaces and Inheritance

WALKTHROUGH VIDEO: http://youtu.be/WD8czND_WRw

In this video we build a simulated bank machine in a Console Application to learn the basics of 
Interfaces and Class Inheritance with C#.

The demo illustrates how different products could be offered to bank customer types, 
without compromising the core business logic of the application which is to allow the user to
maintain their bank account from a cash machine.
